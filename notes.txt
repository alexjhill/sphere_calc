Aim: To approximate the volume of a sphere without any prior measurements

To find the area of a circle: πr^2
where r is the radius of the circle

To find the volume of a sphere: 4/3πr^3
where r is the radius of the sphere

To find pi:

Why?
What if we don't know pi?
It can also be used to approximate the area of other irregular shapes like the bat symbol
2D shapes can be approximated in real life by tossing a stone randomly into a shape
Volume of 3d shapes are much much difficult to approximate in real life without computer assistance
This is a Monte Carlo simulation and can be used for other things like financial modelling, modelling dissipation etc.

How?
Generate circle and a square around it with the same diameter
Randomly plot points within the square
The ratio of dots in the square to in the circle can be used to approximate the area or pi

Extra:
- Find the optimal number of dots to use. Too many will cause more computation, too few won't provide enough accuracy. There might be a sweet spot before diminishing returns.

- Nice JavaScript visualisation with controls for the number of dots, size of sphere etc

- graph to show number of points vs accuracy
